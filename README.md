# CRISPR EFFICIENCY PREDICTION

CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) 
technology, combined with the Cas9 enzyme, has transformed genetic 
biology, but one of the key challenges in implementing CRISPR effectively 
lies in predicting the efficiency of guide RNAs (gRNAs) for specific target 
sequences. The success of CRISPR-based gene editing is influenced by 
multiple factors, including gRNA sequence, target DNA structure, GC 
content, and PAM (Protospacer Adjacent Motif) availability, which makes 
designing optimal gRNAs a complex and time-consuming process.  

Developed as our mini-project this project aims to address this challenge by developing a computational 
tool that leverages machine learning to predict the efficiency of 
CRISPR-based gene editing systems. The tool will analyze key 
sequence-based and structural features of the gRNA and target DNA, using 
models trained on publicly available datasets from experimental CRISPR 
studies. Features such as nucleotide composition, secondary structure, and 
target accessibility will be incorporated to improve prediction accuracy. The 
tool will help researchers design highly efficient gRNAs, minimizing the 
reliance on costly and time-intensive laboratory experiments.  

The project is structured to follow an engineering-driven approach, starting 
with data collection and preprocessing, followed by feature extraction and 
model training. Open-source datasets will serve as the foundation for 
training the models, and additional synthetic data will be generated to 
address potential data gaps. The application will be developed with user 
accessibility in mind, featuring a web-based interface that enables 
researchers to input sequences and receive efficiency predictions in a 
straightforward manner.
